%comment Actually this happened at Discord.
%comment My friend told me that my code is bad, but he didn't said why, he just blocked me.
%comment He told me this many times before and never explained why he think so.
%comment I decided, I do not need friends like him.
%comment I know that I understand that I am also to blame for the fact that we had a quarrel earlier, but I asked for an apology and he forgave me. 
%comment And now the war starts again. I do not want it.
%comment I was looking at our school photos from excursions and camp the other day and I miss the old one @thecakeisfalse.
